Prerequisites
-
1. Install `makedepend` by command `$ sudo apt-get install xutils-dev`
    1. The `Makefile` is partly generated by the `makedepend`. Whenever you add a new module to the project, remember to append the module references to the `Makefile` under `SRC` and `SRC_TEST`. Then run `make depend` to append new targets at the end of the `Makefile`
2. Install `CMocka` test framework. Instructions can be found from [here](https://cmocka.org/)
    1. Create a new folder and move into it
    2. `wget https://cmocka.org/files/1.1/cmocka-1.1.1.tar.xz`
    3. Untar the package `tar -xfv cmocka-1.1.1.tar`
    4. Go into the folder and execute the commands `cmake ./cmocka-1.1.1`, `make` and `sudo make install` (`sudo` is needed to install `cmocka` generally available)

Coding Style
-
The code is (loosly) following this [coding standard](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~eno/coding/CCodingStandard.html)

Build
-
The project is built in a following way:

1. `$ make clean`
2. `$ make build`

You have to ensure that there is neither warnings nor errors during the compilation. All warnings and errors have to be fixed before commits.

Test
-
The tests are executed with these steps:

1. `$ make clean`
2. `$ make test`
3. `$ ./build/yaag`

If you add tests for a new module, follow the existing examples. Remember to append the execution of the tests to the `main.test.c`.

If there is any sign of problem during the execution of the tests, you have to fix it before commits.

Debugging
-
An example about a debugging session:

    $ make clean
    $ make test
    $ gdb ./build/yaag
    (gdb) break tree.c:_tree_remove_subtree
    (gdb) run
    (gdb) n
    (gdb) ...
    (gdb) quit
